# RaspberryPi
Running on rPi3 with Raspbian Jessie

## What's needed?
* You'll need an old version of Mono. Why? Because it works. Read [this guide](http://nadekobot.readthedocs.io/en/0.9/guides/Linux%20Guide/#installing-mono).
* You'd also need to compile your own FFmpeg library if you want to use the audio module. [This tutorial](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2014/11/13/installing-ffmpeg-for-raspberry-pi) should help.

## Additional Options
Execute these in the terminal if you have connection issues:
