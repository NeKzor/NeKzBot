# Audio
The audio module doesn't work without these libraries:

| Name | Descripton |
| --- | --- |
| FFmpeg | Get the static binary for Windows or install it on Linux from the [official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
| Opus Audio Codec | Precompiled binaries can be downloaded from [foxbot's website](https://discord.foxbot.me/binaries/opus).
| libsodium Crypto Library | Thanks for [hosting this](https://discord.foxbot.me/binaries/libsodium) [foxbot](https://github.com/foxbot) :^)

Just put these files into your application folder where all the other binaries are.
